But for now, to understand how some of the features in Python work, we're going to have to provide you with a brief introduction to some basic concepts. \n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a piece of reusable code. If you often want to capitalize a word, you might write (or use, if someone else has written) a \"function\" called `capitalize()` that will take a string and make it all upper case.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object is a collection of data and functions. It turns out that for many types of programming, putting your functions and data together into \"objects\" is a really useful way to organize all of your code to make it easy to keep track of.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a function is part of an object we call it a method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a number of built in functions and various objects in Python have built in methods.\n",

    "* Python comes with a range of built in pieces of code to perform common tasks\n",
    "* Some of them you use by writing their name first - e.g. `type(\"hello\")` - those are called functions\n",
    "* Others require you to take an object and \"call a method on the object\" e.g. `my_name.capitalize()` - they are methods\n",

    "## Python Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Most higher-level languages like Python have types like strings or lists that actually come built-in with some really great functionality, which we call methods. Methods are, essentially, functions that are attached or **bound to an object**. Now that sentence might not make complete sense, so, let's unpack it. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen some methods and functions already. For example, we have seen and used the `type()` function and the `.title()` method. The key difference is that the `.title()` method has always been bound to a string. The `type()` function, however, is not called on a string or any data type. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"hello, i am a string.\".title() # \"Hello, I Am A String.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "type(\"hello, i am a string.\") # str\n",
    "```\n",
    "To illustrate even more clearly, try running the next cell. We will find that Python doesn't know what `title()` is when it is not attached to a string. This is because it is a **method** that is **bound** to the string"
